# Spark-ML-model-example
Spark’s library for machine learning is called MLlib (Machine Learning library). It’s heavily based on Scikit-learn’s ideas on pipelines. 

For this example, we will use a very basic dataset. The Titanic dataset, hopefully, you are all familiar with the case and the data. To start we have to download the data, for that we are using Kaggle:
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Start here! Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics
www.kaggle.com

Just download the “train.csv” file it is also available in this repo.

#### We will be predicting if a passenger survived or not depending on its features.
